# Hello 👋 My name is Evie. 

I am a Backend Software Engineer. I currently work in one of the world's leading sports betting companies as a Java Developer, with fair DevOps and infrastructure exposure. I studied at Makers Academy in London, a 16-week, highly selective, full-time coding bootcamp. Before that, I worked as an in-house IT Support Engineer.  
Software development combines some of my strongest aspects as a person, such as organisation, attention to detail, and problem solving.
