# Hello 👋 My name is Evie. 

I am a software developer. Before that, I worked as a teacher for a few years and later I had a couple of technical roles, the last one being an in-house IT Support Engineer. I studied at Makers Academy, a 16-week, highly selective, full-time coding bootcamp. Software development combines some of my strongest aspects as a person, such as organisation, creativity and attention to detail.
